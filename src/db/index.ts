   *     pages by default; large indexAll runs blow past that).
   *
   * Runs on a WORKER THREAD with its own connection: on a multi-GB index
   * these pragmas are minutes of synchronous IO (a 95k-file kernel index
   * left a 593MB WAL whose checkpoint alone blew the #850 watchdog's 60s
   * window and got a COMPLETED index SIGKILLed at the finish line). WAL
   * checkpointing from a second connection is standard SQLite; `PRAGMA
   * optimize` persists its statistics in sqlite_stat tables, so the main
   * connection benefits the same. The main thread just awaits a message,
   * so the event loop — and the watchdog heartbeat — keep turning.
   *
   * Everything is silently swallowed on failure — best-effort
   * optimization, never load-bearing for correctness. If worker threads
   * are unavailable, falls back to a bounded in-line `PRAGMA optimize`
   * and SKIPS the checkpoint (the final close() checkpoints after the
   * CLI has already disarmed its watchdog).
