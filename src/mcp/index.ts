/**
 * CodeGraph MCP Server
 *
 * Model Context Protocol server that exposes CodeGraph functionality
 * as tools for AI assistants like Claude.
 *
 * @module mcp
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { MCPServer } from 'codegraph';
 *
 * const server = new MCPServer('/path/to/project');
 * await server.start();
 * ```
 *
 * Runtime modes (decided in {@link MCPServer.start}):
 *
 * - **Direct** — one process serves one MCP client over stdio. The pre-#411
 *   behavior; used when the user opts out (`CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1`), no
 *   `.codegraph/` is reachable, or the daemon machinery fails for any reason.
 * - **Proxy** — what an MCP host actually talks to when sharing is on: a thin
 *   stdio↔socket pipe to the shared daemon. The proxy carries the #277 PPID
 *   watchdog, so a SIGKILL'd host reaps its proxy promptly. See {@link ./proxy.ts}.
 * - **Daemon** — a *detached* background process (its own session/process
 *   group) that serves N proxies over a Unix-domain socket / named pipe,
 *   sharing one CodeGraph + watcher + SQLite handle. Spawned on demand; never a
 *   child of any host, so it survives individual sessions and is reaped by
 *   client-refcount + idle timeout. See {@link ./daemon.ts} and issue #411.
 *
 * The detached-daemon + always-proxy split is the fix for the review finding
 * that the original in-process daemon (a) was the first host's child, so closing
 * that terminal severed every other client, and (b) disabled the PPID watchdog,
 * regressing #277 (orphaned daemons on host SIGKILL).
